The Holiday Season is upon Wyoming, Ohio and shoppers are filling the small towns streets. Half Day Coffee Shop owner, Penny Preston, thought her crime solving days were behind her, until one of her favorite customers winds up in a fatal car crash in front of her shop. With no one believing that it could be foul play, Penny must uncover the secrets of the local painter’s life in order to bring him and his family justice. With things just getting interesting between her and Detective Hanson, Penny is trying her best to stay out of police matters, that is until another body is discovered. She can’t ignore her instincts any longer, but will she be able to solve who is behind these killings before she herself becomes the next target?
