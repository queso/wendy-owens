What happens when you find out all the horror you've seen in the world is more than just bad luck? When you find out there is a boogyman? 

For as long as Gabe can remember, his life had been plagued by haunting images and tragic events. It seemed like everyone he knew or loved was doomed for a life of misery or death. He was starting to come to the same conclusion everyone else had--he must be cursed. Until one day, in a subway tunnel, everything suddenly changed. A horrific disaster led him to a strange new person named Uri. 

Uri introduced Gabe to an exciting new world filled with angels, demons, magic, and best of all, a beautiful girl named Sophie. This chance at a new life had everything Gabe always longed for: a family, friends, and possibly even love. He soon discovered, though, that this life came at a steep price. One he feared might cost him his life. 

A prophecy places Gabe in the middle of a choice he could have never imagined he would have to make. He finds out the creatures that have haunted his nightmares are actually real and only the Guardians stand between them and the rest of the world.
