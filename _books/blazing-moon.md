Working as a Royal Magistrate isn’t Tynder’s idea of what her future would have looked like, but it’s the only choice she has if she wants to get close enough to catch her grandfather’s killer.

Instead of catching a break on the case that consumes her thoughts, she’s strapped with a serial killer whose crimes could expose all of Fae kind to the human world. But this moon-struck killer might be more than Tynder can handle.

Although keeping her focus means keeping her distance from the handsome executioner Nash, she may just need him to stay alive.
