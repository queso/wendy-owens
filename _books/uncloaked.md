Today is my twenty-second birthday, and Iâ€™ve been dead for exactly twelve months. I lived my entire life ignorant of the truth and following rules. I don't plan to waste a single moment of my death if only my overprotective grandmother would let me out of her sight.

Wouldn't you know it, the first time she gives me a moment to myself it appears she has been kidnapped. Now if only I can figure out who's the wolf in sheep's clothing soon enough to save the old woman's life.

Enjoy this Urban Fantasy twist on an old fairy tale, Red Riding Hood, complete with vampires and werewolves.
