I"î<p>Why Finding a Community Saved Me.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s 6 am and a tiny hand is poking me in the cheek, less than gently nudging me into consciousness. I ignored it for a moment but based on the wide awake giggles around me I know my toddler isnâ€™t going away. I sit up, kiss my tiny one on the cheek and get my day started. Three kids equal a busy day of cooking cleaning and running them too and from school. The above-described my life when I began my writing career five years ago. I had few mom friends because honestly, who has time for friends? I was trying to write while juggling family life. Something everyone knows a bit about, Iâ€™m sure.</p>
