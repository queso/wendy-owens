I"¹<p>Sometimes, life just has a way of happening and it isnâ€™t always pleasant. I remember driving with my kids to a store one morning and getting a call from my sister that a friend of oursâ€™ teen had died the night before - all I could do was weep at the very thought of it. Later we discovered that our friendâ€™s child had been struggling with depression; we had no clue. As not only a mother, but just a human being who had missed someones desperate need for help, I felt lost. This led to a story forming in my mind that had to be written more than any other Iâ€™d ever written. I tell you this so that you understand my mindset when I wrote <a href="http://wendyowensbooks.com/books/wash-me-away">Wash Me Away</a>. It was not their childâ€™s exact story, but one I hoped would speak to people perhaps just like him or people who knew someone like him.</p>
