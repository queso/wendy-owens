I"e<p>Some people are born into love, some people are born into war, when Gabe discovered he was a Guardian Angel, his life was suddenly thrust into both. If this hidden war wasn’t enough to deal with, Gabe learns he is fated to be the great protector who will one day deliver the last prophet to either safety or death. All of these revelations didn’t matter for Gabe, he only cared that his new life included Sophie.</p>

<p>Sophie and Gabe grew closer over the summer. She is now a fixture in his life that keeps him moving forward. Evil doesn’t stop stalking him just because he found happiness. This time darkness finds it’s way into Rampart manor and Gabe will have to decide if he is willing to risk everything to try and stop it.</p>

<p>No matter how much Gabe is telling himself he can hold it together, when Sophie is the victim of a curse, he’s no longer fighting for himself, but now he’s battling to save one of the few people he has ever cared about. Unsure who they can trust, the inner circle of Guardians at Rampart Manor must figure out a way to help one of their own, before it’s too late.</p>
