The Greatest Books of All Time...

Okay, fine. These aren’t the greatest of all time, but they are some of *my* favorites. It is my firm belief that with every book I read I become a better author. My vocabulary grows, the way I view ideas shifts, the way I use the english language is influenced. All of these things are important to grow. Luckily I love to read!

My taste in books is as eclectic as my taste in music. I’m not sure if this is normal for other book lovers, but I don’t just read in one genre. I read Fantasy, Paranormal, Romance, Thrillers. In fact there is very little I don’t read. Today I want to share with you a list of 15 of my favorites.

In no particular order...

1. [Harry Potter Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545162076/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0545162076&linkId=cc4e373457c2ec2514e202ecc275d4bf) by JK Rowling - I do have a favorite, it’s the seventh book, but I love the series so much I felt it needed listed.
2. [Under Different Stars](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477821120/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1477821120&linkId=23a7e9552006ad13e58ca6b7abdc4ff7) by Amy Bartol - The Kricket Series is stupendiosis, so much so I just made up a word for it. Plus Amy is just an amazing person to meet!

Tahereh is a trend setter. FYI, the audio book is a must have. Done exquisitely.
4. [Hunger Games](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PMGUR7S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00PMGUR7S&linkId=8931a34e9d9b20649742e5d78149bfbe) by Suzanne Collins - Come on, you already know how amazing it is.
