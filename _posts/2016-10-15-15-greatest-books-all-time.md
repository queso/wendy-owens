The Greatest Books of All Time...

Okay, fine. These aren’t the greatest of all time, but they are some of *my* favorites. It is my firm belief that with every book I read I become a better author. My vocabulary grows, the way I view ideas shifts, the way I use the english language is influenced. All of these things are important to grow. Luckily I love to read!

My taste in books is as eclectic as my taste in music. I’m not sure if this is normal but I don’t read in just one genre. I read Fantasy, Paranormal, Romance, Thrillers. In fact there is very little I don’t read. Today I want to share with you a list of 15 of my favorites.

In no particular order...

1. [Harry Potter Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545162076/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0545162076&linkId=cc4e373457c2ec2514e202ecc275d4bf) by JK Rowling - I do have a favorite, it’s the seventh book, but I love the series so much I felt it needed listed.
2. [Under Different Stars](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1477821120/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1477821120&linkId=23a7e9552006ad13e58ca6b7abdc4ff7) by Amy Bartol - The Kricket Series is stupendiosis, so much so I just made up a word for it.
3. [Shatter Me](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062085506/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0062085506&linkId=dda8bf87e5ab513986d04b06a60ef78f) by Tahereh Mafi - Before this book I hadn’t read anything like her style. Tahereh is a trend setter. FYI, the audio book is a must have. Done exquisitely.
4. [Hunger Games](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PMGUR7S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00PMGUR7S&linkId=8931a34e9d9b20649742e5d78149bfbe) by Suzanne Collins - come on, you already know how amazing it is.
5. [Throne of Glass Series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BP0V6BA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01BP0V6BA&linkId=3b6956b236fb7403e75974b8ce63ca0b) by Sarah J Maas - okay, it’s a series, not a single book but if your read it you won’t regret it!
6. [Law of Moses](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PKSZ78M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00PKSZ78M&linkId=a4454c6707d1aa1943cba5094290f648) by Amy Harmon - seriously wow on this one guys!
7. [The 5 Stages of Falling in Love](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P7XAQ22/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00P7XAQ22&linkId=a309bde1f6e7c798dd7e491b1234e14f) by Rachel Higginson - Gutted me! Then I read it again. Gutted me a second time.
8. [Storm Front](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WH7PLS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000WH7PLS&linkId=a821f94d61f39c39f5595b8af1e66243) by Jim Butcher - I am new to Butcher and boy am I glad I gave him a try. I will be trucking through the Dresden files for sure.

I’m now hooked. Though I will say Hopeless is still my favorite.
10. [BFG](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00INIXTKY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=owensmc-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00INIXTKY&linkId=c00e60ad25062cd0c0cdde3fd16e40be) by Roald Dahl - inspired me as a child to be a writer.

All of these books have inspired me in some way to start writing, keep writing, try new generes, and more!
