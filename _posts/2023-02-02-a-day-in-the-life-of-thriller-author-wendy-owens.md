## Starting the day with coffee

I start my day just like most of us - with a cup of coffee. But, instead of scrolling through social media, I use this time to catch up on the nightly news from the night before. It's no secret that staying informed is a crucial source of inspiration for any thriller writer. With the world constantly changing, I need to be in the know to craft the most intense and captivating storylines for my thriller books. You also never know when a news story might spark an idea for the next great psychological thriller.

## Writing those psychological thrillers

After my coffee, I get down to the business of writing crime fiction. I spend most of my day writing but also makes time for research, brainstorming, and editing. As with most mystery writers, I have the most exciting search history, like: 'How to burn down a house and make it look like an accident.' Writing a thriller novel is demanding, and I dedicate a lot of time to delivering the best possible stories to my readers.

I also take time to do 'social writing' with other authors. They will get on a zoom call with me and participate in short writing sprints to help keep my focus on writing the story. My competitive nature keeps me wanting to have the highest word count of the group, pushing my thriller genre writing at a breakneck pace. If I'm not writing or on a group zoom call, you can also find me reading between writing sprints. While I used to read authors like Stephen King or James Patterson as a young adult, I now love to read books by Kiersten Modglin, Freida McFadden, and A. R. Torre.

## Doing the social sharing of thriller books

In the afternoons, I take a break from my writing to take care of some administrative tasks, such as responding to emails and working on my social media presence. I primarily focus on TikTok and Instagram these days. I also try to use this time to connect with her fans and followers, sharing sneak peeks into the writing process and upcoming projects on my mailing list from time to time. You can also find me in the home gym on the treadmill going for a walk, or on the weight bench lifting weights.

## Family time for the author

As the day comes to a close, I try to take a mental health break and unwind with the family. The family loves to have dinner and watch tv together. But don't think for a moment that my mind is not still ticking away, developing new plot twists and nail-biting suspense. As a family we often watche crime drama shows like 'How to get away with Murder' or 'Criminal Minds' as they give multiple points of view into how bad guys work.

I know my daily routine may seem demanding, but my passion for writing and my love for thrilling stories drive me every step of the way. I have written in many genres over the years, but being an author of crime and thriller fiction has been particularly rewarding.
