Have you ever wondered what a day in the life of a thriller author looks like? Well, buckle up because we're giving you a behind-the-scenes look at the routine of USA Today bestselling author, Wendy Owens.

## Starting the day with coffee

Wendy starts her day just like most of us - with a cup of coffee. But, instead of scrolling through social media, she uses this time to catch up on the nightly news from the night before. It's no secret that staying informed is a crucial source of inspiration for any thriller writer. With the world constantly changing, Wendy needs to be in the know to craft the most intense and captivating storylines for her thriller books. You also never know when a news story might spark an idea for the next great psychological thriller.

## Writing those psychological thrillers

After her coffee, Wendy gets down to the business of writing crime fiction. She spends most of her day writing but also makes time for research, brainstorming, and editing. As with most mystery writers, she has the most exciting search history, like: 'How to burn down a house and make it look like an accident.' Writing a thriller novel is demanding, and Wendy is dedicated to delivering the best possible stories to her readers.

Wendy also takes time to do 'social writing' with other authors. They will get on a zoom call and participate in short writing sprints to help keep the focus on writing the story. Her competitive nature keeps her wanting to have the highest word count of the group, pushing her thriller genre writing at a breakneck pace. If she isn't writing or on a group zoom call, you can also find her reading between her writing sprints. While she used to read authors like Stephen King or James Patterson as a young adult, she now loves to read books by Kiersten Modglin, Freida McFadden, and A. R. Torre.

## Doing the social sharing of thriller books

In the afternoons, Wendy takes a break from her writing to take care of some administrative tasks, such as responding to emails and working on her social media presence. Wendy primarily focuses on TikTok and Instagram these days. She also uses this time to connect with her fans and followers, sharing sneak peeks into her writing process and upcoming projects on her mailing list from time to time. You can also find her in the home gym on the treadmill going for a walk, or on the weight bench lifting weights.

## Family time for the author

As the day comes to a close, Wendy takes a well-deserved break and unwinds with her family. The family loves to have dinner and watch tv together. But don't think for a moment that her mind is not still ticking away, developing new plot twists and nail-biting suspense. The family often watches crime drama shows like 'How to get away with Murder' or 'Criminal Minds' as they give multiple points of view into how bad guys work.

Wendy's daily routine may seem demanding, but her passion for writing and her love for thrilling stories drive her every step of the way. Wendy has written in many genres over the years, but being an author of crime and thriller fiction has been particularly rewarding.
