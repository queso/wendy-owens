As a thriller author, I am often asked why people enjoy reading and watching thrillers. The answer is simple: we love to be scared. It's human nature to be drawn to things that excite and challenge us, and the thriller genre does just that.

There's something about the combination of suspense, danger, and mystery that makes for an addictive read. But why do we enjoy feeling scared in the first place? As an author, I aim to create a story that hooks readers from the first page and keeps them guessing until the end.

Writing murder mysteries and thrillers is about exploring the darker side of human nature. The genre allows me to delve into the psychology of a serial killer or a victim's motivations and create complex characters that challenge the reader's expectations. The sense of danger and the thrill of the unknown keep readers on the edge of their seats, and the desire to know what happens next makes them real page turners.

One of my recent books, "The Day We Died," is a perfect example. The story follows Sydney Booth, a woman forced to confront her dark past when a murdered woman is found wearing the same lipstick as her father's victims. Sydney must choose between protecting her family's secrets or bringing a killer to justice, and the suspenseful plot of this psychological thriller keeps readers guessing until the very end.

But it's not just the plot that keeps readers engaged – it's also the characters' emotional journey. We relate to their fears and vulnerabilities and root for them to overcome obstacles. In "My Husband's Fiancée," another of my books, the main character must befriend her husband's new fiancé to find answers to her questions about a brutal murder. The story explores themes of betrayal and loyalty, and the complex relationships between the characters keep readers engaged until the end.

Ultimately, I believe that psychological thriller books allow us to explore the darker side of human nature in a safe and controlled way outside of real life. It will enable us to experience the thrill of danger and the suspense of the unknown without actually putting ourselves in harm's way. As much as we may hate to admit it, there's something about feeling scared that keeps us coming back for more.

But it's not just about the scares – it's also about the storytelling. As an author, I strive to create a gripping and suspenseful story that keeps readers engaged from beginning to end. It's about creating complex and relatable characters and building a world where readers can immerse themselves. The thrill of the unknown may draw readers in, but the emotional connection to the characters keeps them invested.

Ultimately, the thriller genre explores the darker side of human nature, allowing readers to experience the thrill of danger and suspense in a safe and controlled way. Whether you're a fan of my books or love the genre, I hope you'll continue to be drawn to the thrill of the unknown – and the storytelling that keeps us all page turning.
